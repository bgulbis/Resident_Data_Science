Objectives
========================================================

* Discuss important considerations for data collection
* Design a data collection form
* Preparing for data tidying and analysis

Common Mistakes
========================================================

* Combining data collection and tidying
    - Think of each step separately
        + Data collection
        + Data tidying
        + Data analysis
* Collecting aggregated data

Important Considerations
========================================================

* Data collection should facilitate getting data into storage
* Data collection process should be designed to be as efficient as possible

Excel for Data Collection
========================================================

* Should not be used as a data collection form

Why Make a Form if Pulling Data Electronically?
========================================================

* Helps to visualize all of the data points
    - Is anything missing?
* Using a form (can be electronic) reduces data entry errors

Data Collection Form Design
========================================================

* Organize to facilitate efficient data collection
    - Data points should be grouped based on where they are in the medical record
* Have choices to select from as much as possible
    - Faster than writing / typing
    - Ensures consistency in data entry

To Do
=============

* variables with multiple observations
* example resident MUE sepsis 2013-2014
* linking to data in another excel file
* collect raw data points, not calculated / aggregated information
    - platelet decrease >= 50% from baseline
    - heparin units/day
