Objectives
========================================================

* Discuss common data collection mistakes
* Design a data collection form
* Preparing for data tidying and analysis

Primary Goal of Data Collection
========================================================
incremental: true

* Gather all data needed for a project as __efficiently__ and __accurately__ as possible

Common Mistakes
========================================================

* Trying to collect and analyze everything in the same place
* Minimal preparation and testing
* Recording aggregated data
    - Platelet decrease > 50% from baseline
    - Heparin dose in units/day
* Using tools which are not designed for efficient data collection
    - Poorly organized fields
    - Spreadsheets (without a data entry form)

Separate Steps
========================================================
* Think of each step in process separately
    - Data collection
    - Data tidying
    - Data analysis

Preparation - Form Design
========================================================

* Organize to facilitate efficient data collection
    - Data points should be grouped based on where they are in the medical record
    - May be different than how we group information to analyze
* Have choices to select from as much as possible
    - Faster than writing / typing
    - Ensures consistency in data entry

Why Make a Form if Pulling Data Electronically?
========================================================

* Helps to visualize all of the data points
    - Is anything missing?
* Using a form (can be electronic) reduces data entry errors

Spreadsheets for Data Collection
========================================================

* Should not be used for data collection without proper setup
    - Easy to have inconsistent data entry
    - Easy to enter data in wrong place
    - Beware automatic type conversion
        + Ex: Dates
* Use a data entry form to get data into spreadsheet
* Set up data validation to minimize entry errors

Data Entry Forms
========================================================

* Excel Data Form
    - Quick Access Toolbar -> More Commands
    - Choose commands from -> All Commands
    - Scroll to Form and click Add
* More customizable forms can be made for Excel using VBA and macros
* Google Forms
    - More customizable than basic Excel form

To Do
=============

* variables with multiple observations
* example resident MUE sepsis 2013-2014
* linking to data in another excel file
* collect raw data points, not calculated / aggregated information
    - platelet decrease >= 50% from baseline
    - heparin units/day
