Big Data in Healthcare
========================================================

* Preventative medicine
    - Combine data from multiple sources to create predictive models
        + Fitness trackers, medical and insurance records, genetic data, etc.
* Clinical trials
    - Data often kept in silos
        + 96% of potentially available data on cancer patients has not been analyzed
    - Data-sharing will allow for new discoveries which otherwise would not be apparent

Ways to Utilize Big Data
========================================================

1. New sources of data for traditional analysis
1. Identify new causal relationships
1. New analytical methods (i.e., machine learning)
1. Integration of clinical information with operations and research

Data in Research
========================================================

* Data is the second most important thing in research
* The question being asked is the first
* Data may limit or enable certain questions
* It does not matter how much data you have if you are not asking the right question

<small>[The Data Scientist's Toolbox - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools)</small>

Sources of Data
========================================================

* Hospital / system databases
    - Care4, Sovera (manual)
    - EDW, TheraDoc, Cardinal DCOA
* National organizations
    - UHC/Vizient Clinical Data Base / Resource Manager
* Public Data
    - Hospital Compare, Registries

The Problem
========================================================

* Having all of this data is great!
    - Allows for studies with much larger scopes to be completed in reasonable time frames
    - Can perform more in-depth analysis
* Unfortunately, data rarely comes "ready-to-use"
* Preparing the data requires some technical know-how and additional tools
